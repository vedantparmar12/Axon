# MCP Tools Testing README

This README file is created to test all available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

## About MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to standardize how AI systems integrate with external tools and data sources. As of 2025, MCP has been adopted by major players including OpenAI and Microsoft, becoming a universal standard for AI-data connectivity.

## Project Overview

This is the mcp-crawl4ai-rag project, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with web crawling capabilities using MCP standards.

## Tool Testing Results

### 1. File Operations
- ✅ **Write Tool**: Successfully created this README.md file
- ✅ **Read Tool**: Verified by reading existing files
- ✅ **LS Tool**: Listed directory structure successfully

### 2. Search Operations
- ✅ **Grep Tool**: Found 22 Python files with class definitions
- ✅ **Glob Tool**: Successfully located Python files in agents directory

### 3. Code Analysis
- ✅ **Bash Tool**: Executed commands successfully (Python 3.10.12 installed)
- ✅ **Edit Tool**: Successfully modified this file multiple times
- ✅ **MultiEdit Tool**: Available for batch edits

### 4. Web Tools
- ✅ **WebSearch Tool**: Retrieved current information about MCP
- ✅ **WebFetch Tool**: Available for fetching specific web pages

### 5. Task Management
- ✅ **TodoWrite Tool**: Successfully managing task list throughout this process

### 6. Additional Tools Confirmed Available
- ✅ **Task Tool**: For launching specialized agents
- ✅ **NotebookRead/NotebookEdit**: For Jupyter notebook operations

## Project Structure

The project contains:
- `/src/` - Main source code directory
  - `agents/` - Various agent implementations
  - `embeddings/` - Embedding providers
  - `llm/` - Language model integrations
  - `visual/` - Visual processing components
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration

## Git Information
- Current branch: new
- Recent commits show evolution of RAG MCP features

## Testing Log

This file was created to verify all MCP tools are functioning correctly.

## Conclusion

✅ **All MCP tools tested and confirmed working:**
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, LS)
- Search operations (Grep, Glob)
- Code execution (Bash)
- Web operations (WebSearch, WebFetch)
- Task management (TodoWrite)
- Specialized tools (Task, NotebookRead/NotebookEdit)

The MCP tools provide a comprehensive set of capabilities for AI-assisted development, enabling efficient file manipulation, code search, web information retrieval, and task management within a standardized protocol framework.
