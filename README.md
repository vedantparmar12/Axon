# Metropolis

> An autonomous AI engineering platform to accelerate development, automate debugging, and evolve software.

Metropolis is a sophisticated system of AI agents designed to tackle the most complex and time-consuming tasks in the software development lifecycle. It acts as a force multiplier for engineering teams, handling everything from initial code generation and dependency validation to automated debugging and continuous integration.

## The Problem with Modern Development

Software engineering is often slowed by repetitive tasks, complex debugging, and the constant need for integration and maintenance. This manual overhead steals focus from innovation and core feature development.

## The Metropolis Solution

Metropolis automates these burdensome tasks. It combines advanced web crawling for context gathering (RAG), a suite of specialized AI agents, and a secure execution sandbox to create a self-sufficient engineering workforce. It can understand requirements, write code, test its own work, and even evolve its own codebase over time.

### Key Capabilities: Solving Real-World Problems

*   **Autonomous Code Generation & Evolution:** Go from a prompt to a functional codebase. Metropolis can write, update, and refactor code, managing its own version control.
*   **Intelligent Debugging:** Instead of spending hours hunting for bugs, deploy an AI agent to analyze, identify, and propose fixes for code errors automatically.
*   **Automated Integration & Testing:** Ensure your components work together seamlessly. Metropolis runs integration tests and validates dependencies to prevent breaking changes.
*   **Multi-Modal Understanding:** The system can process not just code but also visual documents and web content to build a comprehensive understanding of the project's context.
*   **Secure & Resource-Aware:** All operations run within a secure sandbox with strict resource management, ensuring safety and efficiency.

## Get Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Configure:** Set your API keys and environment settings in a `.env` file (use `.env.example` as a template).
3.  **Run:** Launch the main application.
    ```bash
    python src/crawl4ai_mcp.py
    ```
